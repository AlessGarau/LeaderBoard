As part of a school project, I made a leaderboard for a Runner game.
I mostly used Javascript. Oh, and it was the first time I used Javascript at all.

- Get every score from players and display them on the screen too
- All scores are sort to be displayed in ascending order

## To Conclude

I'm very happy of it, even if I know there is many things to improve and I'll work on it asap to get it even better.
By the way it was also my first Readme 😋
